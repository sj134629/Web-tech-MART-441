## Assignment 12

This weeks assignment was so much easier to do than the past couple of weeks. I was able to follow along with the tutorials that was given. The only issues that I had was trying to change my sprite and figuring out what to use to change my up arrow to my spacebar. I tried to change my sprite to a walking cake sprite, but when I did that it just kept showing the whole spritesheet. I even changed the numbers for the different images in the spritesheet to get to work but it did the same thing. So I just kept the original sprite. I was able to change to gravity in my stars/bubbles. They now will randomly go anywhere on the screen. I get may spacebar to work I just had to type in space instead of up. For my spikes they are not quite the shape of a spike, they are more of a mushroom. I got my mushrooms to kill my player if the player touches them. They are poisonous be carefull. One more mushroom will appear each time the level changes as well. I also made more platforms and changed them because the green platforms are boring. I also was able to make it so the levels change each time the bubbles are collected. I am happy with how it turned out.
