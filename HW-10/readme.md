## Assignment 10

This assigment I am kind of disappointed with. I had a hard time trying to figure out how to keep my squares inside of the canvas. I was able to figure out the first square but not the second square. The second square just moves around randomly and wil; quickly touch the first square without the user knowing. So when the first square move it will sometimes get smaller and the color of the canvas will change. But the user can still go after the second square its just hard. I tryed to see if I can slow down the speed of the second square but when I do that it make it disappear completely. I spent most of my time just trying to figure out collision detection. I still am not fully sure on how to do it. I have tried looking at Youtube tutorials but the code is so differnt from the example that was given that it confuses me when I try to combind them, but i eventully figured it out for one square. I think the easiest part was adding the music to this project. I just went and found some music and put into an autio tag. Also since I took up most of my time trying to figure out collision detection, I wasn't able to make it look really nice. I put in a background image, a title and a discription.
