# Assignment

For this assignment I tried to create a grey killing rainbow game. The idea is to defeat the grey squares to keep everthing else colorful. I had a pretty hard time with this one. Collision detection is my enemy. I had to wrestle with it most of the time. I was able to get my obstacles and collectables to show up and my score, but I had a hard time getting the player to interact with them correctly. I wanted the score to change once it hit the collectible, but it kept changing when it hit both collectibles and obstacles. I looked all over the internet and had some help from my peers and professor, in order to figure it out. The last thing that I had to get was when my player touched to collectible, I wanted the collectible to disappear. I still not sure how to do that. I looked all over the internet and youtube. The only thing I was able to do was change the background a different color for a second when the player hit the collectible. I don't know if maybe I could create a function the would make it disappear, but I tried looking it up and a lot of the stuff just talked about collision detection and if I was clicking my mouse. I even looked up things on changing the opacity but I needed a button or I had to click my mouse. I tried to see if I could combind them, but I kept breaking my code.
