## Assignment 7

So this assignment was another stressful and confusing one, but I eventually figured it out. I first went through the example that was given and tried writting my own code. I first created a class and put 5 methods into the constructor. Within the constructor I created a tosting and a getter. In the toString I called the methods it using this and the I returned them in the getter. I made an array the helped get the information from the class and I created variables that held the array and objects related to the different methods. Then I created a button that randomizes the objects. Once I figured that out I put in the appropiate ids and variables and created a button in my index. Then styled it in my style.css.
The hardest part of about this assignment was figuring where to put return and some of the variables. I really studied the course website in order to figure it out.
