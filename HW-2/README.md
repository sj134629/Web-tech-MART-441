## Assignment 2

This Assignment was actually pretty easy this week. What I did first was create all of my files. I created the index.html, readme.md, and script.js. in my index I wrote in the main tags such at html, head and body tags. In the head tag I put in the meta, title and style tags to get the page all set up. In the style tag I added a background color. In the body tag I created a script tag that would link to my script.js file. In my script.js file I used console.log to create list about my 3 favorite websites, games and artists. The only thing about this assignment was I was just confused about certain things like the set up in the console log, but I eventually figured it out.
