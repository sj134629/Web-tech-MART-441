## Assignment 9

I really hope I got this right. This assignment took me a long time to figure out. I had a hard time just trying to process the information that was given to me. For some reason my brain could not process what a dataset was, but I eventually figured it out. The thing that I had the most difficulty with was trying to recieve the information from the json file that I created. I kept trying to figure out how I would use getJSON to recieve the information and I kept running into errors. I also kept switching different datasets because of the way I set them up caused errors. When I did both of these things it caused me to restart mulitple time. I went throught the course website to try and figure it out, but what really help figure it it was YouTube. I found some videos that helped me. I also created some plug-in's that helped style my data and browser page. I also styled stuff in my css stylesheet. This assignment was very time consuming because I kept messing up, but I got it done and I hope I got it right.
