## Assignment 6

This assignment was very stressfull and very time consuming. I am glad that I had nothing else to do. It took me about 9 hours to figure out this assignment and all the errors that came with it. Most of there errors were probably the tiniest things in the code like commas and quotaion marks. They were very hard to find. So I had to finish creating the mathing game that we had to do last week. I first created a JSON that helpped with storing information. I took that information to help with my information collecting page and the end page where you can get the score of how many attemps it took to match all of the card. I linked all of the pages using window.location and I was able to eventually make a card mathing game that collects your information and then tells you your score at the end. When trying to figure out all of my errors I used google, youtube, the course website, the homework examples and the help from my class including my professor.
